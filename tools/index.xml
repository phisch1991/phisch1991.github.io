      <description>The problem A long time during my career we did not find a good solution for managing diagrams/figures within Markdown or AsciiDoc documentation. We had a source file (e. g. a Microsoft Visio file) and then rendered a pixel file which was included into the documentation. The challenges we had include:
 The application required to modify the source file was not installed (due to cost saving, licensing or carelessness) The source file was on somebody elses computer and he/she did not upload it, so we either had to wait or (in the worst case) create the file again.</description>
